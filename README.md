Win/Win is a vertical space shooter where killing each enemy slowly corrupts the game. Try to aim for the highest score without missing a single enemy. This game is inspired by [Lose/Lose](https://www.stfj.net/art/2009/loselose/) by Zach Gage, where killing an enemy would delete a random file from your computer.
